<h1>State Participation to fight against Human Trafficking and Poverty Rate</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>In this project, I took a look into the number of participating agencies that actively did something against human trafficking and the poverty rate in each state. Using the data, I created the choropleth map of United States, displaying the data of poverty rate and the state participation for each state. </p>
<p>Gathered data using Web API and HTML parsing, and manipulated data using Python to produce cumulative data list. 
I visualized data by showing the poverty rate and the participation by state on US choropleth map using plotly.</p>

<h2>Data Sources</h2>
<p>I used four data sources in total, in which two of them were very crucial, while the other two data sources were there for API input and map visualization purposes. 
The two main data sources:</p>
<ul>
  <li>FBI UCR Human Trafficking 2015</li>
  <li>United States Census Bureau Poverty Statistics SAIPE (Small Area Income and Poverty Estimate)</li>
</ul>

<p>The two other data sources:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Columbia University Website: state & FIPS code</li>
  <li>50states.com</li>
</ul>

<h2>Tools</h2>
<p>Python modules used in this project:</p>
<ul>
  <li>urllib</li>
  <li>bs4 (BeautifulSoup)</li>
  <li>csv</li>
</ul>
